# Fecal.js

Simple JavaScript library for people who frequently mistype `JSON.parse()` and Array methods `pop()`, `shift()`, and `unshift()` or other.

## How to use

Simply include the `lib/fecal.js` file in your document...

```html
<script src="lib/fecal.js"></script>
```

...and it just works. Whenever you do a freudian mistype in your code, everything will work as intended, no errors thrown.

Isn't it great?
